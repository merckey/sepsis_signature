# An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis

This repository contains code for reproducing the key results in the following manuscript: Reyes, M., Filbin, M.R., et al. An immune-cell signature of bacterial sepsis. *Nature Medicine* (2020). 10.1038/s41591-020-0752-4

To run the notebooks, the following data objects and auxilliary files need to be downloaded through a data access request from [Broad DUOS](https://duos.broadinstitute.org) :

* matrix_clustered.h5ad
* matrix_ms1_sort.h5ad
* matrix_bm.h5ad
* fc_abundance_table.csv
* clinical_data.csv
* ms1_sort_table.csv
* ms1_cNMF_usage.txt

The datasets are also uploaded on the Single Cell Portal for secondary analysis and visualization:

* [Patient PBMCs](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP548/an-immune-cell-signature-of-bacterial-sepsis-patient-pbmcs#study-visualize) 
* [Bone marrow stimulation](https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP550/an-immune-cell-signature-of-bacterial-sepsis-bone-marrow-stimulation#study-visualize)
